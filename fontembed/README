libfontembed - font embedding and subsetting library
----------------------------------------------------

This library implements all the stuff required to
embed and subset TrueType fonts, as for example 
required in PDF files. It is completely self-contained,
although a FreeType binding might come sometime in the future.

Currently glyf-flavored TrueType is fully supported,
for OTF, i.e. CFF-flavored TrueType/OpenType, subsetting is not
done; but embedding does work.
And single-byte mode does needs work/thought wrt. to encodings.
Also reencoding and conversion of Type1 to CFF is planned.
PostScript embedding is another goal of the project.

The most important issue that needs fixing is support for
text extraction in the PDF multibyte case (most common),
which requires ToUnicode support; some preparation is already done.

Usage
-----
(TODO)... see test_pdf.c ...

 * for direct sfnt access: use <sfnt.h>
 * for embedding: use <embed.h>  (which includes <fontfile.h>)
